# DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this code is to:  
  # (1) read in the recorded aggregate information from each of the 6 waves of the GLSS 
  # (2) extract/rename the consistently recorded variables (see Waves3-6_AggregatesCompare.xlsx) 
  # (3) extract the geo/admin location of households in each wave of the GLSS  
  # (4) merge to shapefiles in `GIS' data (gisdata.Rdata)
  # (5) aggregate outcomes to ADM1 and ADM2 level 
  # (6) create ADM1 and ADM2 panels of outcomes
